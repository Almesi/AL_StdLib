' This Library is a collection of Subs and Functions used in VBA Excel
' They are based on the VBA programming Language
' They contain basic algorithms like swap, draw, sort(many methods), pathfind, array-methods etc.


' HOW TO USE IT
    ' To Build this Library into your Project copy the code from the file "AL_Module.bas" or import it into your Project
    ' Include "Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications Extensibility 5.3" from the references to your project
    ' Scroll up to the Sub "AL_BuildApplication()" and replace the "YOUR_FILEPATH" with the filepath, where the folder "AL_StdLib" is stored
    ' You do not need to put in a "\" at the end: "XXX\AL_StdLib" is enough
    ' Run the Sub. You can delete this Module now if you want, but dont have to
    ' You now have access to all procedures in this folder
'

' NOTE:
    ' All files are dependend on the "AL_Error, AL_Include and AL_Update" Folder. If you do not have these Included your Code might act funny
    ' Because of this all Folders have these 3 as their minimum requierement to run
'

    ' The inclusion works like this: Folder-->BuildData
    '                                               |--> Creates Component (Takes existing one if same name) and gives it a name
    '                                               |--> Add Code in Order (Write the Includes downwards like you would like to have it on top e.g. README on Top will paste this file on Top)
    ' To add your own code write it in a file with its name
    ' Then Make a "Dependencies", "BuildData", OPTIONAL "HeaderData", OPTIONAL "README" File
        ' BuildData Like This:
            'ComponentType = [1,2 Or 3]
            'ComponentName = "XXX"
            'Includes:
            'File1
            'File2
            'File3
        '
        ' Dependencies like this:
            'AL_Error
            'AL_Include
            'AL_Update
            'Component4
            'Component5
        '
        ' HeaderData is used for Public Declaration and Option Explicit
        ' README should be self explanatory
'
