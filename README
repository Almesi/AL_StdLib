' This Library is a collection of Subs and Functions used in VBA Excel
' They are based on the VBA programming Language
' They contain basic algorithms like swap, draw, sort(many methods), pathfind, array-methods etc.


' HOW TO USE IT
    ' To Build this Library into your Project copy the code from the file "AL_BuildApplication.bas" or import it into your Project
    ' Include "Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications Extensibility 5.3" from the references to your project
    ' Scroll up to the Sub "Build()" and replace the "YOUR_FILEPATH" with the filepath, where the folder "AL_CUSTOMLIBRARY" is stored
    ' You do not need to put in a "\" at the end: "XXX\AL_CustomLibrary" is enough
    ' Run the Sub and after it finishes delete "AL_BuildApplication.bas" and "AL_CustomLibrary.bas" from your project, because most of these codes are already in another folder after building it and it isnt needed anymore
    ' You now have access to all methods in this folder

' NOTE:
    ' All files are dependend on the "AL_Error, AL_Include and AL_Update" Folder. If you do not have these Included your Code might act funny
    ' Because of this all Folders have these 3 as their minimum requierement to run
    ' When building the application a new sheet called "Error" will be generated
    ' Do not delete this sheet, as it is the source to all potential error-messages and is also the home to the errorlog, which shows all errormessages after a code is run



' All further details are found inside the other folders
