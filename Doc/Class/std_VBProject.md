# `std_VBProject.frm`

## Introduction

### What is std_VBProject?

In my Company it is forbidden to use any other programming language but vba
At one point i wasnt able to implement all requierments without the use of .dll files
The problem is, that my companies IT-Security promptly killed my accound when trying to save a workbook with those `Private Declare Function`
My only option was to manually delete the add a component before and delete it after the code is run
This becomes tedious after about 5 minutes, so i started creating this class
The main philosophy of `std_VBProject` is to programmatically handle the Visual Basic Project.
It is inspired by the `#include <iostream>` of C++ 
The only reason for this to be a class is the `Class_Terminate` event.
That is because importing vba code into a project several times will result in duplicates. If the user/programmer does not think about several inclusions it will result in those errors.
To counter that `std_VBProject` allows for temporary inclusion, which will get rid of that code at the end of `Class_Terminate`.
This was the main goal, as this would allow me to use `Private Declare Function` without getting into trouble with IT.



### How to use it
First make sure that Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications Extensibility 5.3 is included into you References
`std_VBProject` allows for several different types of inclusion:
1. Inclusion of Component Files (.bas, .cls, .frm) (exception of .frx files, they cannot be included, but if they are in the same directory as the .frm file it will be included with it)
2. Inclusion of non-Component Files (.txt)
3. Creation of Components and addition of code to it
4. Addition and removal of references
5. Addition of Components from another Project

All of the above can be done temporarely
All of the above can be done with a folder(including all subfolders)

Before you can use any method you first have to use `.Create` and attach a Project



### Extra Information
PasteType has the following modes:
```vb
    PasteType 0 = Include Once
    PasteType 1 = Replace
    PasteType 2 = Include several Times
```
0 will throw an error if the component is already included
1 will try to replace the code in the existing component
2 will include it. If it already exists it will put a number at the end

### Examples

Basic Errorhandling
```vb
    Sub Test()

        Dim x As Variant
        Dim y As Variant

        x = 3
        y = 6
        If Console.Number(x, "<", y) = Console.IS_ERROR Then
            MsgBox("HI")
        End If

    End Sub
```

Example for other Console
```vb
    Sub Test2()

        Dim x As Variant
        Dim y As Variant
        PreDec_Answers = Array("y", "n", "m")
        PreDec_Messages = Array("Your Answer is y", "Your Answer is n,", "Your Answer is m")
        Console.Show
        a = CDbl(Console.GetUserInput("Please input a Number for Variable a ", "Double"))
        b = CDbl(Console.GetUserInput("Please input a Number for Variable b ", "Double"))

        If Console.Number(a, "<>", b) = Console.IS_ERROR Then
        End If
        If Console.CheckPredeclaredAnswer("Do you want to add 2 to the variable a?", PreDec_Answers, PreDec_Messages) = "y" Then
            a = a + 2
            Console.PrintEnter "a is: " & a
        End If

    End Sub

    Sub Say(Text As Variant)
        MsgBox(Text)
    End Sub
```
